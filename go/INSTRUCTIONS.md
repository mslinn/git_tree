# Instructions for Grok

The directory containing the file you are reading is the top-level directory of
an existing software project called `git_tree`. It uses the Ruby language, v3.4+.

I worked with Gemini Coding Assist on the git_tree project for many hours.
I concluded that Gemini was not capable of developing software that used untyped languages.

I would like you to convert of all the files in the git_tree project to a Go work-alike,
including all Ruby classes, methods, etc.
The new project will be called `git_tree_go`.

There are logic errors in the git_tree code.
However, the README.md file and the comments in the code provide lots of documentation.
When in doubt during the code conversion from Ruby to Go,
trust the documentation more than the implementation.

Also adapt the contents of README.md for git_tree_go,
including information about installing, building, testing,
usage and packaging the Go code.
